# Dinosaurus-Island----Character-level-language-model
Welcome to Dinosaurus Island! 65 million years ago, dinosaurs existed, and in this project they are back. We are in charge of a special task. Leading biology researchers are creating new breeds of dinosaurs and bringing them to life on earth, and our job is to give names to these dinosaurs. If a dinosaur does not like its name, it might go berserk, so we have to choose wisely!


Luckily we have learned some deep learning and we will use it to save the day. Our assistant has collected a list of all the dinosaur names they could find, and compiled them into this dataset. To create new dinosaur names, we will build a character level language model to generate new names. Our algorithm will learn the different name patterns, and randomly generate new names. Hopefully this algorithm will keep us and our team safe from the dinosaurs' wrath!

By completing this project we will learn:

1.) How to store text data for processing using an RNN.

2.) How to synthesize data, by sampling predictions at each time step and passing it to the next RNN-cell unit.

3.) How to build a character-level text generation recurrent neural network.

4.)Why clipping the gradients is important.
